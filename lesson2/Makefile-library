# An explicit rule, because I want the Makefile to make libmymath.a if it
# doesn't already exist. The implicit rule for making programs out of C source
# files uses $^ (expands to ALL dependencies) instead of $< (expands to just
# the first dependency), so I'm writing out my recipe in full.

mymath_program: mymath_program.c  mymath.h  libmymath.a
	$(CC) -o $@ $< $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) $(LDLIBS)

# The rule for making the library:

libmymath.a: mymath.o
	$(AR) rcs $@ $<

# And, as usual, the "clean" rule:
clean:
	$(RM) *.o libmymath.a
